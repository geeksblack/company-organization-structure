# Project Directory Structure

This repository is organized into several key departments, each with specific files for managing business functions. Below is a detailed description of each directory and the purpose of the files it contains.


## Directory Breakdown

### Finance Directory
The **Finance** folder contains files that relate to the financial management and reporting of the organization. These documents help track the company's financial health, plan budgets, and generate reports.

- **Budgets**:
  - **Q1Budget.txt**: This text file includes detailed projections for the company's budget in the first quarter of the fiscal year. It may cover areas like projected expenses, income, and any major financial decisions or investments.

- **Reports**:
  - **AnnualReports.pdf**: A comprehensive PDF report summarizing the company's financial performance for the entire year. It includes balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and other key financial data, often reviewed by executives, shareholders, and auditors.

### HR Directory
The **HR** (Human Resources) folder is crucial for managing company policies and handling recruitment efforts.

- **Policies**:
  - **EmployeePolicy.doc**: This document outlines the company's policies regarding employee behavior, conduct, benefits, and rules. It is essential for onboarding new employees and ensuring all staff are aware of workplace expectations and legal guidelines.

- **Recruitment**:
  - **Candidates.csv**: A CSV file that contains details about candidates applying for job positions at the company. Each row typically includes information such as candidate names, contact details, interview statuses, and qualifications. This file is useful for HR teams to track applicants and manage the hiring process efficiently.

### IT Directory
The **IT** folder is where all technical project documentation and support records are stored. It’s essential for tracking IT project development and troubleshooting support issues.

- **Projects**:
  - **ProjectPlan.txt**: This text file outlines the plan for current or upcoming IT projects. It includes key milestones, timelines, objectives, resources, and deliverables. This file is critical for the project management team to ensure projects are on track and properly resourced.

- **Support**:
  - **Tickets.log**: A log file that records support tickets raised by employees or customers. It tracks issues, their status (e.g., open, in-progress, resolved), and the resolution process. This is useful for IT support teams to prioritize issues and ensure timely resolutions for system bugs or user problems.

## Use Case Overview

This file structure is designed to help various departments maintain their documentation in an organized and accessible way. Here’s how each department might use this structure:

- **Finance**: Finance teams use the budget files to track spending and plan for future financial needs, while annual reports help stakeholders understand how well the company has performed financially.
  
- **HR**: The HR department uses policies for onboarding new employees, ensuring they understand the company’s expectations. The recruitment files help the HR team track potential candidates and manage the hiring process efficiently.
  
- **IT**: The IT department uses project plans to organize and track the progress of technical projects. They also rely on support ticket logs to resolve issues quickly and document resolutions for future reference.

## Recommendations for Further Organization

If this project grows over time, consider implementing the following improvements:
- Use a database system to store candidate information (CSV could become unwieldy with many entries).
- Store budget and report documents in cloud storage for better collaboration and version control.
- Consider versioning support tickets (using Git or a dedicated issue-tracking tool) for better tracking of updates and resolutions.
